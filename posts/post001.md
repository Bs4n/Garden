The idea behind this site is a synthesis of contradictions. I have made things without ever sharing them with anyone, and I have shared ideas with others that stayed an idea. This is an avenue to expose myself in a more concrete way to the mass consciousness of the internet. I like the stream of consciousness nature of a digital garden, but how I shape and curate my site will likely be different. Since I find value in stream of consciousness writing in others, I figured I should use it myself. Social media has contributed to a culture of only showing your wins, on your best days, in a curated way. So by using github for this site and for my projects, everyone can see a history of all my mistakes as I go. If I can work on the project within github I will for this reason. I also wanted to use github pages because it is free.

A few ideas to start
- Hosting a project on IPFS
- Exploring machine learning

# About Me

I was a platform agnostic cerfified cloud security engineer until I got burnout. I had the wrong approach toward technology and work, and I currently work in another field. While my true interests do not solely involve technology, I see places where they intersect that motivates me to bring it into existence. I have a conversational level of understanding in a few languages. I also play the flute and practice martial arts.
