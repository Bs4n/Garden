The idea behind this site is a synthesis of contradictions. I have made things without ever sharing them with anyone, and I have shared ideas with others that stayed an idea. This is an avenue to expose myself in a more concrete way to the mass consciousness of the internet. We may all look back on the mass consciousness nature of the internet as a sublimation for the collective unconscious, but this substitution may be happening too rapidly and in ways not presently understood by anyone. 

I like the stream of consciousness nature of a digital garden, but how I shape and curate my site will likely be different. The awareness of this term has given me a new perspective in how to approach a virtual space, mainly by having a static site where I can edit my posts as I see fit instead of a blog where each post is a finished product. Where the version control keeps a log of these changes. Even in this first post I do not like the way my thoughts are being conveyed. I feel that my inner voice has become stilted and my natural writing style has atrophied. Since I find value in stream of consciousness writing in others, I figured I should use it myself.

I think social media has contributed to a culture of only showing your wins, on your best days, in a curated way. So by using github for this site and for my projects, everyone can see a history of all my mistakes as I go. If I can work on the project within github I will for this reason. I also wanted to use github pages because it is free.

A few ideas to start
- Hosting a project on IPFS
- Exploring machine learning

# About Me

I was a platform agnostic cerfified cloud security engineer until I got burnout. I had the wrong approach toward technology and work, and after some time away I feel reinvigorated. I currently work in another field. While my true interests in this life do not involve technology, I see places where they intersect that motivates me to bring it into existence. I have a conversational level of understanding in a few languages. I also play the flute and practice martial arts.
